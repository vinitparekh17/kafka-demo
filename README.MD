## Getting Started

Let's take a quick overview of kafka with nodejs and docker. which I found very easy to get started with.
The source code in 2 different languages is as follows:

- [x] [Nodejs](./nodejs/)
- [x] [Golang](./golang/)

> Note: I am using docker to run kafka and zookeeper. If you don't have docker installed, you can install it from [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
